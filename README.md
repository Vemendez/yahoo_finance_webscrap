# NVIDIA Financial Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook designed to extract, clean, and prepare financial data for NVIDIA Corporation from Yahoo Finance. The project uses Selenium for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation, with the goal of creating clean CSV files ready for financial modeling and analysis in tools like Tableau.

## Key Features:
Extracts Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow data.
Cleans and reshapes the data for easy analysis.
Converts financial values (e.g., trillions to billions).
Replaces "TTM" with the current date for consistency.
Outputs clean CSV files ready for visualization in Tableau.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.8 or higher
